    <p>So basically this was an intresting task for me. though i got confused at some point it was really fun to do this task. and i learnes lots of things.</p>

<p>So I followed this steps:</p>

<p>1) Fork the github/personal-website repo.</p>

<p>2) Install a full <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Ruby development environment</a></p>

<p>3) Install Jekyll and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler">bundler gems</a></p>

<p>4) gem install jekyll bundler</p>

<p>5) cd personal-website</p>

<p>6) bundle install</p>

<p>7) bundle exec jekyll serve</p>

<p>then you will see something like this:</p>

<p>Configuration file: /octocat/personal-website/_config.yml
            Source: /octocat/personal-website
       Destination: /octocat/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with –incremental
      Generating…
   GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data.
                    done in 14.729 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for ‘/octocat/personal-website’
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running… press ctrl-c to stop.</p>

<p>8) now browse to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a></p>

<p>tadaa!your website is ready…
now to coustomize this you can goto _config.Yml file and make the changes you want. I added my instagram handle and hackerrank handle . I also added the repos which i forked in my project section.
and every time i made the changes i used to shut down the server and restart the server by using         bundle exec jekyll serve</p>

<p>I first changed the layout from sidebar to stacked. then changed the theme from light to dark,
then i added my repos i delted the excluded parameters so that i will get all my repo and i gave the limit to 9.</p>

<p>then i added my social media handles in the social media directory line.
then i created new .md file for blog inside the post directory and also created a .md file inside the personal website folder for the resume.</p>
